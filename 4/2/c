In case of a band matrix, we propose to store the diagonals only. An NxN matrix with a bandwidth of m can be stored as a rectangular matrix of size Nx(2m+1) by padding the necessary number of zeros.

Then we can complete the Axb multiplication in time smaller O(N*(2m+1)). Hereby the complexity is reduced to almost linear time.

void multiply_band_matrix(int bmatrix[][], int N, int m, int b[], int res[]) {
    int new_b[] = /* add 2m+1 times 0s in the beginning and end to b */
    for (i = 0; i<N; i++) {
        for (j=0; j<2*m+1; j++) {
            res[i] = bmatrix[i][j] * new_b[j]
        }
        new_b++;
    }
}
